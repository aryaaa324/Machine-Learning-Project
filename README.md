# Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Introduction
Heart disease is one of the leading causes of mortality globally. Early detection is crucial to preventing life-threatening cardiac events. This project analyzes patient medical attributes such as **age, blood pressure, cholesterol, heart rate, chest pain type**, etc., to predict the likelihood of heart disease.

The primary goal is to **build a predictive machine learning model** with **high recall for class 1 (patients with heart disease)** to ensure we **do not miss diagnosing a patient at risk**.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Develop a machine learning model that predicts whether a patient is at risk of heart disease based on medical measurements, focusing on **maximizing recall** to identify as many heart-disease patients as possible.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
* **Explore the Dataset** to understand feature distributions and behavior

The dataset consists of medical records used to determine heart disease likelihood.

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Age | Age of the patient |
| Sex | 1 = Male, 0 = Female |
| RestingBP | Resting blood pressure |
| Cholesterol | Serum cholesterol level |
| Fasting Blood Sugar | Indicator >120mg/dl |
| Chest Pain Type | Medical category for chest pain |
| Max Heart Rate | Achieved during exercise |
| Other Cardiac Indicators | ECG results, exercise-induced angina, etc. |
| **Target** | 1 = Heart Disease, 0 = No Disease |

## ✨ Step-by-Step Explanation (Simple & Clear)

### **Step 1 | Import Libraries** <a name="import"></a>
We begin by importing all the required Python libraries that will help in:
- Data loading and manipulation (`pandas`, `numpy`)
- Data visualization (`matplotlib`, `seaborn`)
- Machine learning model building (`sklearn`)

These libraries provide efficient tools for analysis and model development.

---

### **Step 2 | Read Dataset** <a name="read"></a>
The dataset (`heart.csv`) is loaded into a pandas DataFrame.  
This allows us to work with the data in a structured table format and perform further analysis.

---

### **Step 3 | Dataset Overview** <a name="overview"></a>
In this step, we get an initial understanding of the dataset.

#### **3.1 Dataset Basic Information** <a name="basic"></a>
We examine:
- Total number of rows and columns
- Data types of each feature (numerical / categorical)
- Whether missing values are present

This helps us understand what type of preprocessing is needed.

#### **3.2 Summary Statistics for Numerical Variables** <a name="num_statistics"></a>
Using `.describe()`, we get:
- Minimum and maximum values
- Mean and median values
- Standard deviation (spread of data)

This helps identify irregularities, skewness, and potential outliers.

#### **3.3 Summary Statistics for Categorical Variables** <a name="cat_statistics"></a>
We analyze the frequency of unique categories in features such as:
- Chest pain type
- Exercise-induced angina
- Slope, etc.

This helps understand distribution patterns in categorical variables.

---

### **Step 4 | Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** <a name="eda"></a>

#### **4.1 Univariate Analysis** <a name="univariate"></a>
This involves studying each feature independently.

- **Numerical Features** (e.g., age, cholesterol, blood pressure)  
  → Visualized using **histograms, density plots**
  
- **Categorical Features** (e.g., gender, chest pain type)  
  → Visualized using **count plots / bar charts**

This helps to understand data distribution and detect skewness.

#### **4.2 Bivariate Analysis** <a name="bivariate"></a>
Here we analyze how features relate to the **target variable** (Heart Disease).

- **Numerical vs Target**  
  → Visualized using **boxplots / violin plots**
  
- **Categorical vs Target**  
  → Visualized using **stacked bars / grouped count plots**

This step highlights which features are impactful predictors.

---

### **Step 5 | Data Preprocessing** <a name="preprocessing"></a>
Before training models, we clean and transform the data.

Steps include:
- **Removing irrelevant or duplicate columns**
- **Handling missing values** appropriately
- **Outlier treatment** to reduce distortion
- **Encoding categorical variables** (Label Encoding / One-Hot Encoding)
- **Scaling numerical variables** for models sensitive to value range
- **Applying transformations** if a feature is highly skewed

This ensures the dataset is clean and suitable for model training.

---

### **Step 6–9 | Model Building & Evaluation**

We develop and test **four machine learning models**:

| Model | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Decision Tree** | Simple & interpretable model that splits data into decision rules |
| **Random Forest** | Ensemble of decision trees that improves accuracy and reduces overfitting |
| **KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)** | Predicts class based on similarity to nearest data points |
| **SVM (Support Vector Machine)** | Finds the best boundary that separates the classes |

For each model:
1. Define model and train on training data
2. Perform hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV / cross-validation)
3. Evaluate using:
   - **Confusion Matrix**
   - **Precision, Recall, F1-score**
   - **Accuracy Score**

The primary focus is on **Recall** to correctly detect heart disease cases.

---

### **Step 10 | Conclusion** <a name="conclusion"></a>
We conclude by:
- Comparing model performance
- Identifying the model with the highest recall / best predictive power
- Summarizing key EDA insights and important predictive features
- Suggesting future improvements such as:
  - Collecting more patient data
  - Trying deep learning models
  - Improving medical feature engineering
